What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","- Python is a programming language. It is popular because of its simple rules, easy to read and understand, lots of readymade libreries, wide range of applications, integration capability with othre languages, strong community support  and it is opensourse.\n","\n","\n","Q2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n","- An interpreter runs pytho code line by line to translate HLL to machine language. it reads doce and immidiately does what the code says.\n","\n","\n","Q3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","- Keywords are special words that python already uses for its rules. Example- if, else, for, print, True.\n","\n","\n","Q4.Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","- No, doing this will cause error.\n","\n","Q5. What is mutability in Python?\n","- Mutability means whether an object can be changed after it is created. If an object is mutable, its content can be changed.\n","\n","\n","Q6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","- List's purpose is to do some do some operations on them but tuples are meant to be fixed.\n","\n","\n","Q7.  What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","- \"==\" checks wheather two values are equal. \"is\" checks wheather both objects are in same memory.\n","\n","\n","Q8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","- Logical operations always gives boolian value after combining and evaluating conditional statements. Example- and, or, not.\n","\n","\n","Q9. What is type casting in Python?\n","- Type casting means converting a value from one type to another. Example- from string to integer, from integer to float.\n","\n","\n","Q10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","- Implicit casting hapens automatically by python, where as explicit casting is when the programmer converts types using functions.\n","  Example:\n","  Implicit casting- b + c\n","  Explicit casting- int(b) + c\n","\n","\n","Q11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","- Purpose of conditional statement is to enabling dicission making and to control flow of execution of programme.\n","\n","\n","Q12. How does the elif statement work?\n","- \"elif\" means else if. It folows an if function, it executes when if function gives a \"False\" value.\n","\n","\n","Q13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","- \"for\" loop repeats a fixxed number of times or go through items in a sequence. it is uses when numer of iterations is known.\n"," \"while\" loop is to repeat the process as long as a condition is True. It is used when number of iterations is unknown.\n","\n","\n"," Q14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n"," - Condition: keep asking a user for a password until they enter it corrently. in this case number of try is infinite or umknown."],"metadata":{"id":"YpnQOTCpcjri"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Practical Questions"],"metadata":{"id":"B31qnq8-pp-J"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Q1.
